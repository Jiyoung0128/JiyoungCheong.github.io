## Project
### Using Three Tree-Based Ensemble Models to Assess the Risk of Myocardial Infarction
*Course project for the Data Structures*  
Myocardial Infarction is caused by clotted blood block vessels. It brings sudden chest pain without early symptoms and has 33% death rate upon arrival at the hospital. So we built model for checking the risk of Myocardial Infarction easily and frequently. We used tree-based models because it is easy to understand the decision making process and the searching is fast in trees in terms of time complexity. We used Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data for training the model. We trained decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoosting models and XGBoosting showed the best model performance with F1-score 0.9751.

### Building Drug Usage Prediction Model
*Course project for the Data Science Foundations*  
Drug abuse is a huge social problem in the U.S. We tried to build prediction model to drug use frequency. We used National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data provided by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). The target variable we used was 'the number of days one used marijuana in one year.' We first trained a random forest regressor, whose cross-validated $R^2$ ranged from -6.8 to -2.7  and applied Yeo Johnson and Bayesian optimization for better performance which showed cross validated mean $R^2$ is 0.23. Also we further discussed about ethical issues involved in using data such as race, economic status, and educational level to predict drug use frequency.

### Logistic Regression Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence by Smoking Duration and Occupation
*Course project for the Health Medical Database*  
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancer in South Korea, and among men, it has the highest incidence rate. In addition, lung cancer has a poor prognosis. So I conducted logistic regression analysis of lung cancer incidence by smoking duration and occupation. I used Korea Health Panel Survey data for the analysis. The analysis showed that having an occupation with high asbestos exposure did not adequately explain the presence of lung cancer. In contrast, past smoking duration was a strong explanatory variable. We found that for every one-year increase in past smoking duration, the probability of not having lung cancer decreased by a factor of 0.9278, indicating that a longer history of smoking increases the likelihood of developing lung cancer. Regarding model fit, the R statistic suggested that the model was not adequate, whereas the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and the ROC curve’s AUC value indicated that the model had good fit.

### Finding Reliable Confidence Interval for the Odds Ratio through Simulation and Visualization
*Course project for Computational Statistics*  
There are different ways to compute the confidence interval for the odds ratio (OR) with
common methods suggested by Woolf, Agresti, and Gart. This work focuses on finding the best
method for calculating the OR using simulation and visualization in different ways, focusing on
the analysis of the three common methods with and without Welch’s adjustment. Parameters
were chosen ranging from moderate values to extreme ones, with 1760 unique combinations in
total. Monte Carlo simulation was used for examination. According to the output, tw, ta, and zw
performed well with ta showing the most success. The only case in which ta failed was when
both population sample sizes were extremely small. In addition, further exploration was applied
to a real-world example of smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis. Other simulation studies
with 90% and 99% confidence levels were also performed.

### Relationship between Academic Achievement and Future Career and Living
*Course project for Calling BS in the Age of Big Data and AI*  
We wanted to determine if certain education factors can help predict future careers and living outlooks through data analysis. Using the dataset 'Education & Career Success' sourced from Kaggle, we focused on two research questions, 'Which educational factors among university ranking, university GPA, and field of study are related to work-life balance?' and 'Is university GPA related to job offers, starting salary, and
years to promotion?' We used regression analysis, ANOVA, and decision tree for the analysis but we couldn't find a significant relationship between academic performance, future living, and success.
