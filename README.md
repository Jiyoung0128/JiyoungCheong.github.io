## Project
### Using Three Tree-Based Ensemble Models to Assess the Risk of Myocardial Infarction
*Course project for the Data Structures*  
Myocardial Infarction is caused by clotted blood block vessels. It brings sudden chest pain without early symptoms and has 33% death rate upon arrival at the hospital. So we built model for checking the risk of Myocardial Infarction easily and frequently. We used tree-based models because it is easy to understand the decision making process and the searching is fast in trees in terms of time complexity. We used Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data for training the model. We trained decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoosting models and XGBoosting showed the best model performance with F1-score 0.9751.

### Building Drug Usage Prediction Model
*Course project for the Data Science Foundations*  
Drug abuse is a huge social problem in the U.S. We tried to build prediction model to drug use frequency. We used National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data provided by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA). The target variable we used was 'the number of days one used marijuana in one year.' We first trained a random forest regressor, whose cross-validated $R^2$ ranged from -6.8 to -2.7  and applied Yeo Johnson and Bayesian optimization for better performance which showed cross validated mean $R^2$ is 0.23. Also we further discussed about ethical issues involved in using data such as race, economic status, and educational level to predict drug use frequency.
